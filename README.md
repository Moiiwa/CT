Pull requests with suggestions and improvements, however small or big, are welcome!

The changes in lecture slides are going through an automated check.

The PDFs are compiled and updated automatically when PR is merged (thanks to k1rill-fedoseev!). You don't need to update them manually.
They are also uploaded as workflow artifacts for every new commit pushed into this repository. You can use them to see your changes.
