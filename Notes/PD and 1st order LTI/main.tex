Assume we have dynamics:

\[
\dot x = Ax + Bu
\]

Let $u =  K_p x + K_v \dot x $. If $B$ is invertible, we can pick $K_v$ such that $K_v = B^{-1}$ and obtain:

\[
\dot x = Ax + B(K_p x + B^{-1} \dot x)
\]

\[
\dot x = Ax + B K_p x + \dot x
\]

\[
0 = (A + B K_p) x
\]

Which means $x$ is in the null space of $(A + B K_p)$. However, the initial problem did not specify this, therefore for any $x \not\in \text{null}(A + B K_p)$, the proposed control should lead to an instantaneous change in $x$, which is not physically possible or meaningful.

Alternatively, pick $u =  K_p x + B^{-1} \dot x  - c$. Then we obtain:

\[
\dot x = Ax + B K_p x + \dot x - B c
\]

\[
(A + B K_p) x = B c
\]

\[
 x = (A + B K_p)^+ B c
\]


Here it means that any $x$ in column space of $(A + B K_p)^+ B$ can be achieved instantaneously, which is not physical or meaningful.
